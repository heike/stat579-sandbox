### The lonely t

t was feeling lonely. It had just met with unif and norm, who had been talking about normal tests, significances and distributions of p-values. t hadn't been able to get a word in. Unif and norm then took t's lunch money. The end. t was angry and invited cauchy to stand with it. Cauchy liked t, and helped t fight back.

In the end, t and Cauchy were victorious and reclaimed t's lunch money.


This story reminds me of a similar story my supervisor once told me 
That's nice.
