### The lonely t

t was feeling lonely. It had just met with unif and norm, who had been talking about normal tests, significances and distributions of p-values. t hadn't been able to get a word in... or a letter. Unif and norm then took t's lunch money. The end.
## t can do a lot of things to help us with real life questions

Poor t
